 ### **Notes for the Windows Vista installer**
  You need to run it, as an administrator
  You have to select the installation directory manually, ( C:\Program Files\Mant08\Y2038BUG ).
  The installer and the program, can be caught as trojans (False Positive!). Make an exception in the AV, and restore the compoments caught as trojans of the software. **(DON'T RESTORE AS WELL AND REAL VIRUSES, ONLY THE FALSE POSITIVES PARTS OF THE PROGRAM AND THE INSTALLER)**
